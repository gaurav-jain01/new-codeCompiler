## Features

- üéØ **Kid-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive UI designed for young learners
- üìù **Code Editor**: Built-in Monaco editor with syntax highlighting
- üîå **Arduino Integration**: Automatic Arduino device detection and connection
- ‚ö° **One-Click Upload**: Compile and upload code to Arduino with a single click
- üñ•Ô∏è **Cross-Platform**: Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- üé® **Modern UI**: Built with React and Tailwind CSS

## Prerequisites

### For Development
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)
- Git

### For Arduino Programming
- Arduino board (Uno, Nano, Mega, etc.)
- USB cable to connect Arduino to computer
- CH340 driver (for Arduino clones) - automatically installed on Windows

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CYE-Compiler
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install main dependencies
npm install

# Install renderer dependencies
cd renderer
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3. Download Platform-Specific Binaries

#### For Windows
The Windows binaries (`arduino-cli.exe` and `CH341SER.EXE`) are already included in the `bin/` directory.

#### For macOS
Run the provided script to download Arduino CLI for macOS:
```bash
chmod +x download-mac-binaries.sh
./download-mac-binaries.sh
```

**Important**: For macOS, you'll need to manually install the CH340 driver:
1. Download from: https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver
2. Follow the installation instructions

#### For Linux
You'll need to download the appropriate Arduino CLI binary for your Linux distribution and place it in the `bin/` directory.

## Development

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
# Start both React dev server and Electron
npm run electron-dev
```

This will:
- Start the React development server on `http://localhost:3000`
- Launch Electron with hot reloading enabled
- Open developer tools automatically

### Building the React Frontend
```bash
npm run react-build
```

### Testing Production Build
```bash
npm run test-prod
```

## Building for Distribution

### Building for All Platforms
```bash
# Build React frontend first
npm run react-build

# Build for all platforms
npm run build
```

### Platform-Specific Builds

#### Windows
```bash
npm run build:win
```
Creates a Windows installer (NSIS) in the `dist/` directory.

#### macOS
```bash
npm run build:mac
```
Creates a macOS DMG file in the `dist/` directory.

#### Linux
```bash
npm run build:linux
```
Creates Linux AppImage and other formats in the `dist/` directory.

## Building for macOS Desktop Version

### Prerequisites for macOS Build
1. **macOS Development Machine**: You need a Mac to build the macOS version
2. **Xcode Command Line Tools**: Install via `xcode-select --install`
3. **Code Signing Certificate**: For distribution outside the App Store

### Step-by-Step macOS Build Process

1. **Prepare the Environment**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you're on macOS
   uname -a
   
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   cd renderer && npm install && cd ..
   ```

2. **Download macOS Binaries**
   ```bash
   chmod +x download-mac-binaries.sh
   ./download-mac-binaries.sh
   ```

3. **Build the React Frontend**
   ```bash
   npm run react-build
   ```

4. **Build the macOS Application**
   ```bash
   npm run build:mac
   ```

5. **Find the Built Application**
   - The DMG file will be created in `dist/` directory
   - Look for `CYE_Uploader_<version>.dmg`

### Code Signing (Optional but Recommended)

For distribution outside the Mac App Store, you should code sign your application:

1. **Get a Developer Certificate**
   - Sign up for Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
   - Create a Developer ID Application certificate

2. **Configure Code Signing**
   Add to your `package.json` build configuration:
   ```json
   "mac": {
     "target": "dmg",
     "icon": "assets/icon.ico",
     "artifactName": "CYE_Uploader_${version}.${ext}",
     "category": "public.app-category.developer-tools",
     "identity": "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)"
   }
   ```

3. **Notarization (Required for macOS 10.15+)**
   ```bash
   # After building, notarize the app
   xcrun notarytool submit CYE_Uploader_1.0.0.dmg --keychain-profile "notarytool-profile" --wait
   ```

### Troubleshooting macOS Build Issues

1. **Missing Arduino CLI**: Ensure the macOS Arduino CLI is downloaded and executable
2. **Permission Issues**: Run `chmod +x bin/arduino-cli` if needed
3. **Code Signing Errors**: Check your certificate and provisioning profile
4. **Gatekeeper Issues**: For testing, right-click the app and select "Open"

## Usage

### First Run
1. Launch the application
2. Connect your Arduino board via USB
3. The app will automatically detect your Arduino
4. Start coding in the editor!

### Writing and Uploading Code
1. Write your Arduino code in the editor
2. Click the "Upload" button
3. The app will:
   - Compile your code
   - Detect the connected Arduino
   - Upload the code to your board
   - Show progress and results

### Supported Arduino Boards
- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Nano
- Arduino Mega
- Arduino Leonardo
- Most Arduino-compatible boards
